# Project Name

Server Side Calculator

## Description

In this project, I created a user interface that replicated a calculator grid. Using this interface, a user can enter in their mathematical input by clicking on the numbers/operators. When the user click `=` button, the client will send data over to the server via POST and calculate the user input and send over the result via GET onto the client and rendering it on the browser for the user to see. This project will also keep a history of past calculations and the most recent result. Clicking the `C` button will clear the input display allowing for a new calculation to be made. Along with these calculator functions, the project has input validations that will only calculate if the user input is available or formatted correctly.
